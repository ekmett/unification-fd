=== Thanks ===

Christopher Anand --- for partially funding this work at McMaster
    University during the summer of 2011.

Nathaniel W. Filardo --- for helping to figure out the intricacies
    of unification in Dyna2 (though this code is at best loosely
    based on that work).

Edward Kmett --- for pointing out the weighted extension to path
    compression (popular in the union--find literature).

The two-level types approach was adapted from Tim Sheard[1]. The
initial (simple yet naive) implementation of unification was based
on Sheard's presentation of Cardelli's[2] algorithm in Modula-2.
Efficient backtracking search via the logict library is described
by Kiselyov et al.[3] The idea of functional pointers were independently
discovered by Dijkstra et al.[4] after their apperance in Dyna2.
